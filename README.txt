Data file description (available from: https://zenodo.org/record/5846443)

A. kilimanjaro_ipbes_workshop_habitat_questionnaire.csv

Data from the ‘habitat’ questionnaire, entered by Catherine A. Masao and Mark A. Snethlage (finalised 2020-09-22). Individual perceptions about the state of and trends in habitats and species diversity and about the direct and indirect factors driving these trends. We invited participants to fill out separate questionnaires for each habitat of importance to their sector or for which they had knowledge, starting with the most important one.

B. kilimanjaro_ipbes_workshop_ecosystem_services_questionnaire.csv

Data from the ‘ecosystem services’ questionnaire, entered by Catherine A. Masao and Mark A. Snethlage (finalised 2020-01-09). The ‘ecosystem services’ questionnaire collected individual perceptions about the state of, trends in, and importance of NCP (Nature's Contributions to People), as well as about the factors driving observed changes in access and provision. With reference to the preliminary group discussion on NCP, we invited participants to fill out separate forms for each NCP they deemed important to their sector or had knowledge about and to indicate which habitat(s) provide(s) each of them.

C. kilimanjaro_ipbes_workshop_ecosystem_services_access_change_codes.csv

Adapted from the ecosytem services questionnaire data (kilimanjaro_ipbes_workshop_ecosystem_services_questionnaire.csv), coding the reasons for change in access to NCP. 

D. kilimanjaro_ipbes_workshop_spatial_scales_recommended_measures.csv

Tally of recommended measures towards recorded from the carousel session, grouped by spatial scale and Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) categories. See Table S7 for details.
